   This project centers on a comprehensive Sales Analysis for the Bright Coffee Shop, commissioned to provide a new CEO with actionable insights for improving revenue and product performance.
   As a Junior Data Analyst, the work addresses key business objectives: identifying the highest revenue-generating products, determining the store's peak operational times, and analyzing sales trends across products and time intervals. 
   The core methodology involved a multi-step process utilizing SQL and Snowflake for data processing.
   This transformation phase was critical, calculating the total_amount (unit price*transaction quantity). 
   Following processing, the resulting dataset was exported to Microsoft Excel, including pivot tables and charts, that summarize total revenue per product type, peak sales periods, and top-selling items. 
   The final output is a formal Presentation to the CEO that details the approach, presents the visual-backed insights.
